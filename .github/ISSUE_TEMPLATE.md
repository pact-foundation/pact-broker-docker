# Pre issue-raising checklist

I have already (please mark the applicable with an `x`):

* [ ] Confirmed this is the right place to raise the issue - issues for the Pact Broker application itself should be raised in the [Pact Broker](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker) project.
* [ ] Upgraded to the latest Pact Broker Docker image OR
* [ ] Checked the [CHANGELOG](/CHANGELOG.md) to see if the issue I am about to raise has been fixed
* [ ] Read the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/DiUS/pact_broker-docker/wiki/Troubleshooting) page

## Software versions

* **pact-broker gem version:** eg 2.3.1
* **pact-broker docker version:** eg 2.3.1-1
* **OS**: e.g. Mac OSX 10.11.5
* **pact broker client details:** eg. pact-ruby-standalone CLI v 1.23.0
