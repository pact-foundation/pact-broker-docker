  ##
  # Sequel by default does not test connections in its connection pool before
  # handing them to a client. To enable connection testing you need to load the
  # "connection_validator" extension like below. The connection validator
  # extension is configurable, by default it only checks connections once per
  # hour:
  #
  # http://sequel.rubyforge.org/rdoc-plugins/files/lib/sequel/extensions/connection_validator_rb.html
  #
  #
  # A gotcha here is that it is not enough to enable the "connection_validator"
  # extension, we also need to specify that we want to use the threaded connection
  # pool, as noted in the documentation for the extension.
  #
  # -1 means that connections will be validated every time, which avoids errors
  # when databases are restarted and connections are killed.  This has a performance
  # penalty, so consider increasing this timeout if building a frequently accessed service.
  logger.info "Connecting to database with config: #{config.merge(password: "*****")}"
  connection = Sequel.connect(config.merge(logger: DatabaseLogger.new(logger)))
  connection.extension(:connection_validator)
